# Scambuster

Building AI course project

## Summary

Identify sites that are not real businesses but trying to scam people with fake products or services


## Background

At his point almost everyone has been exposed to an online scam in one way or another.  The rate at which these scams are being developed is extremely high and there are virtually no mechanisms to identify or prevent these scams from hurting people.  Additoinally there is very little recourse to hold bad actors accountable for these crimes.



## How is it used?

The solution will be to identify indicators (key words, website characteristics, reviews etc) that can be used to identify fraudulent sites and/or interactions.
