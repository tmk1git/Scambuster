# Scambuster

Building AI course project

## Summary

Identify sites that are not real businesses but trying to scam people with fake products or services


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?
At his point almost everyone has been exposed to an online scam in one way or another.  The rate at which these scams are being developed is extremely high and there are virtually no mechanisms to identify or prevent these scams from hurting people.  Additoinally there is very little recourse to hold bad actors accountable for these crimes.



## How is it used?

The solution will be to identify indicators (key words, website characteristics, reviews etc) that can be used to identify fraudulent sites and/or interactions.   

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   

   # write your solution here

  
main()
```
